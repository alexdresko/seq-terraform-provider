# seq_api_key (Resource)

Use this resource to create and manage API keys in Seq via `/api/apikeys`.

Seq may only return the key `token` at creation time; it is stored in Terraform state as a sensitive attribute.

## Example Usage

### Basic API Key

```terraform
resource "seq_api_key" "ingest" {
  title       = "terraform-ingest"
  permissions = ["Ingest"]
}
```

### API Key with Input Settings

```terraform
resource "seq_api_key" "app_ingest" {
  title         = "my-application"
  permissions   = ["Ingest"]
  minimum_level = "Warning"
  filter        = "@Level = 'Error' or @Level = 'Fatal'"
  
  applied_properties = {
    Application = "MyApp"
    Environment = "Production"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `title` (String) Human-friendly title for the API key.

### Optional

- `applied_properties` (Map of String) Properties to attach to all events ingested via this API key. These will override any existing properties with the same names.
- `filter` (String) A filter expression to apply to incoming events. Only events matching the filter will be ingested.
- `minimum_level` (String) Minimum log level for events ingested via this API key (e.g. Verbose, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Fatal). Events below this level will be discarded.
- `owner_id` (String) Owner principal id. Depending on permissions, you may only be able to set this to yourself.
- `permissions` (Set of String) Permissions delegated to the API key (e.g. Read, Write, Ingest, Project, System).

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Seq API key id.
- `token` (String, Sensitive) The API key token/secret. Seq may only return this on create; it is stored in state as sensitive.
