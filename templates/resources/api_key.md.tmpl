# seq_api_key (Resource)

Use this resource to create and manage API keys in Seq via `/api/apikeys`.

Seq may only return the key `token` at creation time; it is stored in Terraform state as a sensitive attribute.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "seq_api_key" "ingest" {
  title       = "terraform-ingest"
  permissions = ["Ingest"]
}
```
